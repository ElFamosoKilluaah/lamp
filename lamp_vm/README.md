# Lamp
Lamp is yet another registers-based VM.

# Status
This project is still a work-in-place and will not be achieved before a long moment.

# Used resources
This project was supposed to be written using the subnetzero's tutorial, but I finally decided to directly use the documentation of his project: https://gitlab.com/subnetzero/iridium/-/blob/master/docs/manual.adoc

# TODO
-Everything (lol)
